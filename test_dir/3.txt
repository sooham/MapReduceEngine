at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a ca
rriage of her own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh, and saying, "Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She   
would be very glad to stay." There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks  
brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse. The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by being wished
 joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach   
 could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be different from himself. What was unwholesome to him he 
 regarded as unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all,  
 and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at the pains of consulting Mr.     
 Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the 
 comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the
 bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. 
 With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair;   
 but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone. There was a strange rumour
  in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr. Woodhouse 
  would never believe it.
